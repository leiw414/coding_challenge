**Phase1**
* A simple PHP library, which will calculate the mean, median, mode, and range of a set of numbers, is named "statistic.php" and located at /code/application/libraries/statistic.php.
* I made a controller to test the statistic library. localhost/code or localhost/code/index.php/test


**Phase2**
* I made a REST API for the statistic library which is located at /code/application/controller/mmmr.php
* I made a Rest Client file called rest_api_post_test.php at the root directory
