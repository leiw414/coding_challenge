##Software Developer Coding Challenge##

A composer.json file is created and put at root directory. The extenal framework I used is Codeigniter 2.1.4.

**Phase1**
* A simple PHP library, which will calculate the mean, median, mode, and range of a set of numbers, is named "statistic.php" and located at /code/application/libraries/statistic.php.
* I made a controller to test the statistic library. You can test it @ 
```
http://localhost/code
```
or 
```
http://localhost/code/index.php/test
```

**Phase2**
* I made a REST API for my statistic library which is located at /code/application/controller/mmmr.php
* I made a Rest Client file called rest_api_post_test.php at the root directory
